# Makathon-2025

We won the Cornell Makathon 2025, getting number 1 out of about 40 hardware and software teams. The theme was "tech for well-being". Our product was an exoskeleton for assisting arm lifting and rehabilitation exercise. One of our teammate Keegan lost the nueral control to his bicep after a wrist surgery.
